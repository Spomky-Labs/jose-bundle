This Symfony bundle provides services to create, load, verify or decrypt JWT.
It uses [spomky-Labs/jose](https://github.com/Spomky-Labs/jose) to ease encryption/decryption and signature/verification of JWS and JWE.

# The Release Process

The release process [is described here](doc/Release.md).

# Prerequisites

This library needs at least:
* ![PHP 5.6+](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-5.6%2B-ff69b4.svg)
* Symfony 2.7+ or Symfony 3.0+

# Continuous Integration

It has been successfully tested using `PHP 5.6`, `PHP 7` and `HHVM`.

We also track bugs and code quality using [Scrutinizer-CI](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/Spomky-Labs/jose-bundle/) and [Sensio Insight](https://insight.sensiolabs.com/projects/5398e4ca-1a48-4186-9410-f44f3f850a05).

Coding Standards are verified by [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/repos/28856829).

Code coverage is not performed.
We rely on tests performed on the library and we only have implemented `Behavior driven development` (BDD) to test this bundle. 

# Installation

The preferred way to install this library is to rely on Composer:

```sh
composer require spomky-labs/jose-bundle

class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            ...
            new SpomkyLabs\JoseBundle\SpomkyLabsJoseBundle(),
        ];

        return $bundles;
    }
}
```
